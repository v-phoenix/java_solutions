/**
 * Problems that are solved using Dynamic Programming technique.
 * 
 * What is Dynamic Programming?
 * 
 * Dynamic Programming is a technique used to solve optimization problems where a given problem 
 * can be broken down into sub problems. Each sub problem is solved and solution is saved (or memoized).
 * 
 * The solution to the given problem is then assembled from the solutions of sub problems.
 * 
 * The term "Dynamic Programming" is a little misleading. It was named this way due to the lack of better for these types of solutions
